Vine Depths Zone is an April Fools song and will not get in the mod or any future mods. You are free to make a mod of it yourself, however, this wouldn't be here if you weren't.
Two sets of vocals are included, one set using the TGT Sonic chromatic as in the YT upload, and one set using an original chromatic sampling Ryan Drummond's Sonic performance.
